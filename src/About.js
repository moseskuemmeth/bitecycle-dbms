        Bitecycle: About Us Fighting Food Waste, One Pedal at a Time Bitecycle
        is more than just a web app; it's a movement fueled by the desire to
        nourish both people and the planet. We believe that everyone deserves
        access to fresh, healthy food, and that no edible morsel should go to
        waste. That's why we created a platform that seamlessly connects
        businesses with surplus food to the communities that need it most. Our
        Story Bitecycle was born from a simple observation: restaurants, grocery
        stores, and farms often have perfectly good food that they can't use or
        sell before it spoils. Meanwhile, countless people struggle to put food
        on their tables. We saw a gap in the system, an opportunity to bridge
        the divide between abundance and need. How We Work Bitecycle works like
        a well-oiled bicycle chain, connecting every link in the food supply
        chain. Here's how: Businesses: Restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, and
        farms list their surplus food on our platform, specifying quantities,
        expiration dates, and any dietary restrictions. Non-profit partners:
        Food banks, shelters, and community kitchens use Bitecycle to find and
        claim the food they need, ensuring it reaches those who need it most.
        Tech-powered efficiency: Our user-friendly interface and real-time
        updates make it easy for everyone involved to manage their donations and
        pickups. The Impact We Create Since our launch, Bitecycle has: Diverted
